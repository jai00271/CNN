*Receptive Field Calculations*

By applying a convolution C with kernel size **k = 3x3**, padding size **p = 1x1**, stride **s = 2x2** on an input map **5x5**, we will get an output feature map **3x3**  Applying the same convolution on top of the 3x3 feature map, we will get a **2x2** feature map. The number of output features in each dimension can be calculated using the following formula
